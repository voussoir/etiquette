Etiquette
=========

This is the readme file.

### To do list
- At the moment I don't like the way that warnings and exceptions are so far apart, and need to be updated individually. Consider moving the warning strings to be class properties of the matching exceptions.
- User account system, permission levels, private pages.
- Generalize the filename expression filter so it can work with any strings.
- Improve the "tags on this page" list. Maybe add separate buttons for must/may/forbid on each.
- Some way for the database to re-identify a file that was moved / renamed (lost & found). Maybe file hash of the first few mb is good enough.
- Move out more helpers
- Debate whether the `UserMixin.login` method should accept usernames or I should standardize the usage of IDs only internally.
