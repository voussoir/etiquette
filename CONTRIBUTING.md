============

I am using Etiquette to learn and practice. Breaking changes are very common. Bugs, while not intended, are not surprising.

Please do not open pull requests without talking to me first. For serious issues or definite bugs, you may open a Github issue. If you just have a question, please:

- send an email to `etiquette@voussoir.net`,
- send a reddit PM to [/u/GoldenSights](http://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=GoldenSights), or
- send a message on Discord to voussoir#7582. You should also email me as I don't log in often.
