Contributing
============

I am using Etiquette to learn and practice. Breaking changes are very common. Bugs, while not intended, are not surprising.

Please do not open pull requests without talking to me first. For serious issues and bugs, open a Github issue. If you just have a question, please:

- send an email to `etiquette@voussoir.net`, or
- send a reddit PM to [/u/GoldenSights](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=GoldenSights)

If you want to chat in real time, I am `voussoir` on [freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/) and `voussoir#7582` on Discord. Please message me the other ways first because I don't log in to these often.
