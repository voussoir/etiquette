Please do not open pull requests without talking to me first. For serious issues and bugs, open a GitHub issue. If you just have a question, please send an email to `contact@voussoir.net`.

If you want to chat in real time, I am `voussoir` on [freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/) and `voussoir#7582` on Discord. Please email me first so we can coordinate.

I also mirror my work to other git services:
